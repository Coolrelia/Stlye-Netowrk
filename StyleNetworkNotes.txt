Combat System:
Objective: Make your enemies HP drop to 0

Each character has 4 moves and a basic attack (maybe a passive ability)
QWER - space
Q, W, and E are basic abilites while R is an ultimate ability
Each move has a cooldown while your R can only be used with an S rank
Tile based movement, each player has a 3x3 grid they can move around on; entire battlefield is 3x6

Each player has a Style Meter: E D C B A S
The Meter starts at E and ends at S
The meter goes up by 1 every time the player lands a unique attack on the enemy 
the meter goes down by 1 if the player doesn't attack after 3 seconds of the previous attack or use the same attack in a row

q - a - w - a - e - a
This combo would get your rank up to S assuming you landed all your abilites and auto attacks

Playable Characters:
Gun Man:
Basic: shoots little gun
Q: Sword - attacks tile directly infront of player
W: Wide Sword - attack the whole row of tiles infront of the player
E: Long Sword - attacks 2 tiles directly infront of player

Sword Man:
